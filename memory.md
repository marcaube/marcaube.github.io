# Memory

Here are a few resources I use to improve my memory and mental maths skills.

- [Guess the Day of the Week](/dow-trainer/), a game to practice calculations with the [Doomsday algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule).
- [Find the root of perfect squares](/perfect-square-root-trainer/)
- [Find the root of *any* square](/square-root-trainer/), a game to practice calculations with the [Babylonian method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Babylonian_method).
